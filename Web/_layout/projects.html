            <p>Our team is currently testing more than 20 types of alloys for the powder bed fusion (PBF), binder jetting and directed energy deposition (DED) processes. We are working with our industry partners to characterize and test their newly developed alloys. Examples are M789 steel, Corrax stainless steel, Heatvar, and L-40 tool steel.</p>

            <p>The current electrification of the transportation industry will need efficient electrical steel for induction motors to maximize the mileage and reduce power consumption. We are working with Natural Resources Canada and their industry partners to design the alloy and process to maximize the magnetic permeability and minimize core losses.</p>

            <p>Reducing the weight of body-in-white assemblies can reduce the energy consumption of both gas- and electric-powered automotive vehicles. Thus, our team works on the development of medium-Mn steels, which can replace the heavier conventional steels without compromising the safety of passengers.</p>
