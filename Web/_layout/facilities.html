                <p>The <strong>Gleeble 563 TMS system</strong> is a fully integrated digital closed loop control thermal and mechanical testing system. Physical simulation of materials processing aims to replicate the precise thermal and mechanical conditions experienced by the material during its real-world fabrication or application. The accuracy of the simulation is crucial for its usefulness, as reliable results allow for seamless transfer from the laboratory to full-scale production processes.

                <p><strong>Scanning Electron Microscopy</strong> is an advanced testing technique that involves scanning a sample using an electron beam to create highly magnified images for detailed analysis. This method, also referred to as SEM analysis and SEM microscopy, is particularly valuable for microanalysis and failure analysis of solid inorganic materials. Operating at high magnifications, SEM yields high-resolution images and allows precise measurements of extremely small features and objects. This sophisticated imaging tool provides valuable insights into the intricate structures and characteristics of materials.</p>

                <p> The <strong>Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar </strong> or Kolsky bar, is employed to evaluate the stress-strain behavior of materials under high strain rates, typically ranging from 100 to 10,000 1/s. This method is applicable for studying material responses in compression, tension, and shear.</p>
